        <p>Edwin Hubble is best known for his work in Astronomy, credited with several discoveries. Two of the largest ones include: </p>
        <li><em><strong>The universe is much larger than the Milky Way galaxy.</strong></em> In the early 1900's the common belief among physicists and astronomers was that the al the stars in the sky belonged to the Milky Way galaxy, and that this contained the entire universe. Using something called a <strong>standard candle</strong>, he measured that certain cloudy areas in the night sky (called nebula at the time) were so far away, that there was no possible way that they could be in the Milky Way galaxy, and concluded that there must be other galaxies in the universe. </li><br>
        <li><em><strong>The universe is expanding away from us.</em></strong> During Hubble's time, the common belief about the state of the universe was that it was constant and infinite. Specifically, they believed that it has always existed, and was infinite in expanse. Through his research, he found out that these galaxies that were very far away from our own were actually moving further away from us. Take it one step further, the farther the galaxy was, the faster it was moving away from us. This implied that the entire universe was expanding and that it was taking the galaxies with it. Taken to it logical conclusion, this is the origin of the Big Bang Theory.  </li>
